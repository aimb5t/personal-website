I'm a consultant at Accenture where I specialize in delivering programs that identify, prove, and scale the value of AI solutions for IT, Business, & Customer. My recent industries of focus have been utilities, software & platforms, and life sciences.

I've spent my career in growth marketing, incubation & entrepreneurship, research labs, design studios, and professional services answering frontier questions for industry shapers at:
- Public Institutions like MIT Media Lab
- NFPs like Future Cities Canada
- Fortune 100s in automotive, cloud computing, sports, and others

My work has been featured at WEF in Davos, Rutgers School of Management & Labor Relations' Kelso Fellows, Metagov, and more. 

My interests include asset-based community development, strategy, culture, ownership, learning, and the future of knowledge work.
